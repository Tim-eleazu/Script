The pipeline defined here is for triggering and monitoring Bitbucket pipelines for specific repositories, branches, and trailers. It uses a Python script to handle the triggering and monitoring process. Here's a brief description of its components:

Pipeline Definitions:

Step triggerpipeline: This step is responsible for:
Printing the Bitbucket pipeline UUID.
Navigating to the Bitbucket clone directory.
Setting up a Python virtual environment.
Installing required Python packages.
Running a Python script (config_trigger.py) with arguments for trailer, repository, and branch.
Cleaning up by deactivating and removing the virtual environment.
Custom Pipeline ConfigureTrailer: This allows the user to configure and trigger pipelines based on specific trailers, repositories, and branches.

Python Script Description
The Python script (config_trigger.py) performs the following tasks:

Authentication: Uses a Bitbucket authentication token stored in the environment variable BITBUCKET_AUTH_TOKEN.
Triggering Pipelines:
Forms the appropriate API request to trigger a pipeline in Bitbucket for the specified repository and branch.
Sends the request and captures the pipeline UUID.
Monitoring Pipelines:
Periodically checks the status of the triggered pipeline.
Prints logs for each step of the pipeline.
Error Handling and Result Reporting:
Monitors for completion and success/failure of all steps.
Stops execution if any step fails or is stopped.
